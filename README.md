# Vehicle-Routing-Problem-using-Genetic-AI
The code uses Genetic Algorithms to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem by optimizing routes for vehicles visiting locations and returning to a depot. It starts with random solutions, evaluates route fitness (shortest distance), and improves them through crossover, mutation, and selection. The final routes are visualized on a 2D map with Matplotlib.
